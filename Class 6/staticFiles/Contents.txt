    8. Problems:
        - Using a loop print all even numbers up to and including n = 10. Don't include 0
        - Given two arrays of integer. Add up each elements in same position assuming both arrays
        are of equal length. arr1 = [4, 6, 7] arr2 = [8, 1, 9]

Practice Problems:
    - Using a loop print all odd numbers up to and including n = 10. Don't include 0
    - Using a loop output the elements in reverse
    - Given an array [3, 5, 22, 5,  7,  2,  45, 75, 89, 21, 2]. Output the sum of all their elements // Output => 276
    - Given two arrays of integer. Add up each elements in same position assuming both arrays
    are of variable length. Also, print "Cannot add elements" if both arrays are empty.
        Sample Input 1 - arr1 = [4, 6, 7, 12] arr2 = [8, 1, 9] // Output => 12 7 16 12
        Sample Input 2 - arr1 = [4, 6, 7, 12, 9, 6] arr2 = [] // Output => 4, 6, 7, 12, 9, 6
        Sample Input 3 - arr1 = [] arr2 = [] // Output => Cannot add elements
